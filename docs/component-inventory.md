# Component Inventory

Quick scan result (minimal project):
- `app/app.vue` — uses NuxtWelcome; no custom components detected.

Next steps:
- Add domain components under `app/components/` and import into pages/layouts.
- Document new components here as they are added (category, purpose, props/events if applicable).
